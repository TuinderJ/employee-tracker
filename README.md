# Employee Tracker

## Description

This CLI app allows a user to navigate through a SQL database and manipulate it's data through selecting items from a list.

- My motivation for this project was to learn the basics of SQL queries.
- I built this app to simulate what an employee database would look like in a business setting.
- This solves the problem of manually keeping track of employees and their jobs.
- I learned about SQL databases and the different things that you can do with queries.
